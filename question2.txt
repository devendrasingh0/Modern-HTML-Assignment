
HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent reserved characters in HTML. 
Reserved characters are characters that have special meaning in HTML, 
such as the less than (<) and greater than (>) signs. If you use reserved characters 
in your text, the browser might mix them with HTML tags.

To use an HTML entity, you place an ampersand (&) at the beginning of the entity name 
and a semicolon (;) at the end. For example, to display the less than (<) sign, you 
would use the entity &lt;.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&lt; - less than (<) sign
&gt; - greater than (>) sign
&amp; - ampersand (&) sign
&quot; - double quotation mark (") sign
&apos; - single quotation mark (') sign

These entities can be used to display any character in HTML, even characters that are 
not supported by the user's keyboard. For example, you could use the entity &copy; 
to display the copyright symbol (Â©).
