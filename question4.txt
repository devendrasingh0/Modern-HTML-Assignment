Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

Use semantic HTML elements: Semantic HTML elements are used to describe the meaning 
of the content on a web page. This helps screen readers and other assistive 
technologies to understand the content of the page and provide a better user 
experience for people with disabilities. For example, you can use the <header> 
element to indicate the header of the page, the <footer> element to indicate the 
footer of the page, and the <section> element to indicate a section of the page.

Provide alternative text for images: Alternative text (alt text) is a text description 
of an image. This text is displayed to screen reader users instead of the image. 
It is important to provide descriptive alt text for all images on your web page so 
that screen reader users can understand the content of the images.

Use descriptive links: Link text should be descriptive so that screen reader users 
know what the link will take them to. Avoid using generic link text such as "Click here" 
or "Read more." Instead, use descriptive link text that accurately describes the 
content of the linked page.
