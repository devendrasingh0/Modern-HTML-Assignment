        <h2>Semantic elements</h2>
        HTML5 introduces new semantic elements, such as header, footer, and section, 
        which make it easier to structure and organize web content. These elements help screen 
        readers and other assistive technologies to understand the content of a web page and 
        provide a better user experience for people with disabilities.
        <p>For example, you can use the header element to indicate the header of the page, the footer 
        element to indicate the footer of the page, and the section element to indicate a section of the page.</p>
        <h2>Multimedia support</h2>
        HTML5 includes native support for audio and video, allowing developers to embed multimedia 
        content into their web pages without having to rely on third-party plugins. 
        This makes it easier to create rich and engaging web experiences for users.
        <p>To embed audio and video content into a web page, you can use the audio and video 
        elements, respectively. These elements provide a number of attributes that allow 
        you to control the playback of the audio and video content.</p>
        <h2>Canvas element</h2>
        The HTML5 canvas element is a powerful tool for creating graphics and animations 
        in the web browser. The canvas element is a rectangular area on a web page where 
        you can draw using JavaScript.
        <p>The canvas element can be used to create a variety of graphics and animations, 
        such as charts, graphs, and games. It can also be used to create interactive elements, 
        such as drawing tools and paint programs.</p>
